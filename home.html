            <p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...</p>
            <p> It is a period of civil war. Rebel
                spaceships, striking from a hidden
                base, have won their first victory
                against the evil Galactic Empire.</p>
            <p>
                During the battle, Rebel spies managed
                to steal secret plans to the Empire's
                ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an
                armored space station with enough
                power to destroy an entire planet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents,
                Princess Leia races home aboard her
                starship, custodian of the stolen plans
                that can save her people and restore
                freedom to the galaxy.... </p>
